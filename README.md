## Awesome Notification Test Assignment
This project demonstrates how to integrate mobile notifications into a Flutter app using the awesome_notifications package. It covers setup steps, including adding dependencies, configuring Android permissions, and initializing the notification service. The app can display various types of notifications â€” from basic, summary, and progress bar to big image, messaging, action button, and scheduled notifications. It also handles user interaction with notifications, including navigation to different screens based on notification actions.
